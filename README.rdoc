A dating website founded on the idea that each member keeps a blog. Features most of what you would expect to find on any dating website (basic questions, pictures, a messaging system, a matching system based on location and age preferences), but also allows each user to write blog entries.

What better way to get to know someone than by looking at what they write and think the most about?

I don't really intend for this to ever see production, but it's a fun way to practice, experiment, and learn.
